Description of Pokemon Picture Quiz:

This app is a simple picture-based quiz using pokemon characters. You collect pokemon by encountering them in a quiz. There are two tabs: the first is for the quiz, the second displays your collected pokemon.

On launch, the user starts in the quiz tab and is presented with 4 pictures of pokemon and a name; they must identify the named pokemon by tapping on the correct picture. Doing so will increase score by 1. There is a timer bar that indicates the time remaining for a given quiz session. Correct answers will increase time remaining and incorrect guesses will decrease time remaining. As the user's score increases, the timer ticks faster.

The second tab displays all the pokemon you have encountered by displaying their sprites in a collection view. Tapping the sprites will take you to a detail view that displays some of their character data. Play the quiz and try to catch all the pokemon!

Note: The PokeAPI used for this app had 718 pokemon accessible at the time of this app's creation. Since the API does supply any reliable method to determine what is the maximum number of accessible pokemon, I have hard coded the app to limit calls to the aforementioned 718 pokemon.
