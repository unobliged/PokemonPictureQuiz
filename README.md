# PokemonPictureQuiz
This was the final class project for the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.
Given the requirements, I opted for a simple quiz game powered by the PokeAPI.
The user is presented with a name and pictures of four pokemon; they must correctly identify the named one to score.
As the user plays more rounds, pokemon are collected and made viewable in the collection view in the 2nd tab.
Clicking the sprites there displays a detail view for the pokemon with some of its stats.
